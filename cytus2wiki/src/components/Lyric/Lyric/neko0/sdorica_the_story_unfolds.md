The darkest valley  
The highest mountain  
We walk in the name of our brave  
The rushing river  
The blooming flower  
Descended from heaven we embrace  
  
The steps we take  
And the pain from journey  
Could never ever bring us down  
The keys discovered  
The new worlds opened  
Let's run and catch the dawn  
  
Money, power, fame  
We want them all the same   
Justice, wisdom, strength  
We strive to keep with our faith   
Stars keep twinkling  
Forget your fears  
Build a garden with no more tears  
  
Someday our path  
Part ways in the forest we see  
I know what you seek  
But it isn't for me  
I wouldn't change  
Won't give in   
It's vital to me  
Even alone  
I'm proud of my beliefs  
   
We chase the light  
And darkness where nobody knows  
We're on different ways  
With separate goals  
And I will fight for my honour  
Rather than yours  
Stay away  
I'm on my own world  
  
The time is now  
The story unfolds......
