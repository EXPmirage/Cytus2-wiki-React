I wish upon a black star, and you said all right.  
It starts new vision of world.  
  
I meet you on the starry hill tonight.  
You are prince and star, black-est.  
I heard somebody cry out in the box.  
Thus prayed, with your power  
  
You say "We should eat "Apple"!!  
The worst things in life come free to us every time.  
In the dark, I'm gonna get back all fates like so.  
Ah... Hellow, New fetal world.  
  
I wish upon a black star, and you said all right.  
It should redo all of misfortunes;  
But you are liar, and deadly sin.  
The beginning(wowowow...), Dark spreads in the world.  
  
Hope for despairs, Despairs for hopes  
  
Just awake, Let them go!  
Do it, Let them go!  
There is my new order.  
  
Hope for despairs, Despair for hopes  
Just awake  
Hope for despairs, Despair for hopes  
  
It is new orders.
