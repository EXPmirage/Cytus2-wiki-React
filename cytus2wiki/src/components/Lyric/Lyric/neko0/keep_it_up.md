Bounce Come on bounce check it  
Give me some nuon piece and I'mma wreck it  
Break it to pieces in a goddamn second  
Battle it up just like my name check in  
Take a look, you’re looking to the best around  
Official I see for track the town  
And we’ll come back to it whenever allowed  
There’s no doubt, just walk fire into the crowd  
Move that body we like to party  
All over the world we leave no club tidy  
Check it in a second we’ll be back no doubt  
Y’all here we come and turn the party out
