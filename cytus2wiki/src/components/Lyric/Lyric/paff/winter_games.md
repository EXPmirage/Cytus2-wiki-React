All the store lights     
Shining so bright    
Warm the chill in the air    
Through their doors stream melodies of winter, winter, winter     
   
    
In the windows   
Framed with fresh snow       
Gifts are wrapped up with care     
But all I want this year is to have   
    
     
Winter Games   
Oh, fill the cups   
Cinnamon kisses from you, from you   
Candy canes   
Oh, light it up   
Nothing else I need   
But you   
   
    
Dreams of nutmeg  
Filling my head   
Make my memories so sweet   
Of you and I brave the weather, oh, together   
   
     
Singing carols   
Throwing snowballs   
As I run through the streets   
Honey, this year, don't you want to have...?
