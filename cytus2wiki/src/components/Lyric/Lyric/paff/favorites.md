When I feel so sad that I remember the scenery   
My skies turn ripe like moonlight   
Never know, never know, no one will know   
Just as I close my eyes trying to tell myself

Never know, never know, no one will know

Listen with my heart, my heart    
Believe in myself, feel my   
Listen with my heart, my heart   
These are my favorites, favorites    
   
    
When I feel so sad that I remember the scenery
