Stranded in reminiscence   
The voice’s covered in dirt    
I seal the sadness on the ocean    
Bleak edge behind the siren   
The path cannot reverse     
I look upon the stars in the frozen air    
Maybe this is the message    
They say astrology   
If only I felt your heartbeat   
(How I wish you were here)    
   
      
Take a moment to reflect on the story we used to have   
Silent tears blended in heavy rain    
Apathetic dream in my loneliness   
Don’t let me drown in your isolation   
Suffocate in the shelter   
   
     
Obscure memory vanished   
Vision’s getting blurry   
You never told me the meaning   
Frigid emotionally   
Solitary drift in the sea   
Close your eyes   
I will leave   
   
     
Take a moment to reflect on the story we used to have   
Silent tears blended in heavy rain   
Apathetic dream in my loneliness  
Don’t let me drown before your confession   
   
    
Take a chance to recollect memories before erased    
Disappearing shapes in my dread   
Effervesce   
Cast away    
I cry your name   
Nothing's left in the farthest void Still my heart remains...   
   
    
Innocent smile will perish   
Absurd and realistic
