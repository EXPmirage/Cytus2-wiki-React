Build a firewall and I‘ll break the code   
Spare some time in regime till I hack the vote   
Have no appetite for risk but you gotta learn    
Run my algorithm and you’ll see the world   
    
    
Ghost in the mirror   
begging for revelation   
Heritage of grim nature   
resonates in the verse   
Counterclockwise propaganda flows in the air   
Evil dream takes over me   
Steals my skin   
   
    
Gravitating idiosyncrasy   
while we fall asleep   
in a mesmerizing abyss   
We are slaves playing hide and seek   
   
    
Shut down   
Terminate   
Withdraw from helpless endgame   
The time is running out   
Where's my way   
  
    
How do you survive the freefal   
How much can you tolerate the loss  
Herding together may kill us all  
I hold my breath   
To a great escape   
   
   
Gravitating idiosyncrasy  
while we fall asleep  
in a mesmerizing abyss  
We are slaves playing hide and seek   
    
    
Pull me under   
Unspoken illusion   
drives me out of my mind   
I'm falling deep   
Deep enough to dive into the other side   
Irreversible contagion  
Surrounded by explicit humanity   
You show me
