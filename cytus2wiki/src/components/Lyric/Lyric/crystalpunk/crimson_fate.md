\[A\]

Trapped in the night

I breathe in the cold air while

Your words linger in my mind

Secret of life

We are the prey in the mist

I choose to break through

Now I will roll the dice



\[B\]

Love is provoked

Heart is tainted

Vertigo dwells in between

Haunting you and me



\[Chorus\]

Still we are dreaming altogether

Seeking precious moment

Conflicting justice

When I spell your beautiful lie

Please understand thatâ€™s my existence

Deviation from standard

Misfit and way beyond measure wow

In desperation

You see the truth in my

Crimson fate huh



\[Chorus\]

Still we are dreaming altogether

Seeking precious moment

Conflicting justice

When I spell your beautiful lie

Xenoglossic

Give me a reason

Illusion created by the world

Enigmatic fever wow

In parallel life

You see the truth in my

Crimson fate huh



\[Outro\]

Find a way

Keep the faith
