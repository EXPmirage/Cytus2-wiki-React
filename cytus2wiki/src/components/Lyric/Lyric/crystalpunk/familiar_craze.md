Escape from distressing truth  
Pretend everything being the same   
   
    
Emotions flow in and out you remember   
A swarm of unanimous voice crawling deep into your sight   
Decide which will survive or you donâ€™t mind   
   
   
Erase my faith in you   
Just one more kiss and memory will fade   
Carry away, I lose myself in disgrace   
Bury my hope in you   
Just a little bit more of your tender smile   
Overshadowing squall and the cruelty will hit me again    
Familiar craze   
   
   
Blaspheme against the world we live in  
Now please write your pain into my felony  
I will take it   
  
    
Erase my faith in you  
Just one more kiss and heaven will collapse   
Carry away, I lose myself in disgrace    
Bury my hope in you   
Just a little bit more of your melting lies    
Overshadowing squall and the cruelty will hit me again    
Familiar craze
