Says   
Tell me he says  
I got frayed,   
Like I'm insane, oh-oh.  
Hey,   
Tell me your name    
I got a gray,    
Don't wanna cry no more.    
   
    
There is no way,   
There is no hope,   
There is no guy,   
That you can trust.   
There is no way,   
There is no hope,   
There is no guy...   
   
   
Oh no   
You capture me,    
From right inside, oh-oh,   
You capture me.  
I don't   
I don't know why    
I needed you, oh-oh,     
You capture me.   
   
   
Oh-oh, you capture me.  
  
     
There is no way,   
There is no hope,  
There is no guy,  
That you can trust.  
There is no way,  
There is no hope,  
There is no guy...  
  
   
Oh no   
You capture me,  
From right inside, oh-oh,  
You capture me.  
I don't  
I don't know why  
I needed you, oh-oh,   
You capture me.  
  
   
Oh-oh, you capture me.
