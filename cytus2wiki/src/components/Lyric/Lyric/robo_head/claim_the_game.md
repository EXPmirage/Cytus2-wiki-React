My eyes keep on flashing,no resting,for sixty seconds,  
I'm here to win the game,set another stunning record,  
My mind keeps on pushing,no limits,beating your tests for me,  
Expanding capabilities,a lethal weapon recipe!  
  
My body keeps adapting,ever faster, second sixty seconds,  
Analysing failures when my fingers break the speedrecord,  
Masters never quit or surrender,until there is no one better,  
Flawless runs all day,I am here to claim the game!
