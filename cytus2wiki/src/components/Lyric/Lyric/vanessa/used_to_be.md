Nobody can hear   
Iâ€™m barely breathing   
All of my dreams   
No longer being in my story    

No body can see   
Now I'm standing   
On the way you lead   
Trying everything but fading   

between me and me   
Even if it's reality   
It won't become new memories   

You used to be...   
You used to be...   
How could you leave?  
How could you leave?   

You used to be...   
You used to be...   
How could you leave?  
How could you leave?   
(Now I can see)   
You used to be me
