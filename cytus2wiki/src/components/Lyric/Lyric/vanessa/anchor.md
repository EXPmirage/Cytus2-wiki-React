Time is fading away,  
So much has been lost to date   
All of our sacrifices, our love should suffice   
In this tribulation, Oh.   
     
Gravity is pulling me,    
but I learned how to anchor myself to my feet   
With this new-found strength,   
I will carry your burdens together with you   
   
Yes, our love will come through    
   
There’s many reasons to grieve the past   
but I chose to rise above it all    
Forgiveness is power, the healing that last    
So let this beat in your heart,   
Forever more

I will carry your burdens together with you   
   
Oh, there’s many reasons to grieve the past   
you must choose to rise above it all   
Can you hear me?  
Have I finally reached you?    
  
Won’t you believe,    
Forgiveness is power, the healing that lasts   
So let this beat in our hearts,   
Forever more
