Wake up   
Can you hear the gravity   
is now on beat   

Tell me what is fake and real   
On the edge of lie and truth   
Can you recognize yourself?   

Don’t you remember what they said to you?   
The rumors hurt your feel     
The rumors against your will   
Don’t give it up   
Go pursue “your own” freedom and dreams   
While they tore us apart    
Then we all alone  
Now we all alone    

So we break it, we break it, we break it    
  
The rule of (d)ark is time to end up    
Take your soul back and now stand up   

True north of your heart   
You will see who you are   

Burn to ashes into the sun   
Till the end of day you’ll find out from your heart    
Seeking the whole rest of brand new world    

We break it, we break it, reload the faith in your eyes   
We chase it, we chase it, love used to be in our mind    
We break it, we break it, we believe the truth won’t buried alive
